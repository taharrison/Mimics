recorder
	ensure histories are generated with unique calls

equality strategy for BV   *** requested by steve


flags for behaviour in order / idempotent / stateless   *** requested by alan


check if functions have out/ref parameters and fail on recording if so ***


support functions with out parameters **


log types and return types as both base and actual??


better exceptions when unexpected calls happen 

data structure to support fast look up

make serialisation and equality check into a strategy

tidy code

documentation comments

enable a test pattern (possibly in conjunction with nunit) which allows consumer testing ONLY under one context (using persisted history) and integration testing under the other test context (and behaviour verification too?)


check if types are uniquely /accurately serialisable
tool to help identify if a type is serialisable - deep equality check using reflection



BUG: replay proxy cannot replay histories recorded from older version assemblies
